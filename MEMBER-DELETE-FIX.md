# Member Delete Functionality - Fixed

## Problem
When deleting members from the admin dashboard:
1. Members disappeared from the dashboard but remained in the Supabase database
2. Deleted members could still login with their credentials
3. Some pages showed deleted members (tasks page) while others didn't (upload page)
4. Inconsistent behavior across the application

## Root Cause
The system was using a **soft delete** approach (marking status as "Deleted") but:
- Not all queries filtered out deleted users consistently
- Auth context didn't check for deleted status on login
- Team management page wasn't filtering deleted users when fetching

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Consistent Soft Delete Pattern
All member queries now filter out deleted users:
```typescript
.eq("role", "member")
.neq("status", "Deleted")  // ✓ Now applied everywhere
```

### 2. Updated Files

#### `app/admin/team/page.tsx`
- ✓ Added `.neq("status", "Deleted")` filter when fetching members
- ✓ Changed delete to update status instead of hard delete
- ✓ Updated warning message to reflect soft delete behavior

#### `app/admin/tasks/page.tsx`
- ✓ Added `.neq("status", "Deleted")` filter when fetching members for task assignment

#### `lib/auth-context.tsx`
- ✓ Added check for deleted status during profile fetch
- ✓ Automatically signs out users with "Deleted" status
- ✓ Shows error message: "Your account has been deleted. Please contact administrator."

### 3. Already Correct Files
These files were already filtering deleted users properly:
- ✓ `app/admin/upload/page.tsx`
- ✓ `app/admin/files/page.tsx`
- ✓ `app/admin/page.tsx` (dashboard)

## How It Works Now

### When Admin Deletes a Member:
1. User's status is updated to "Deleted" in database
2. User is removed from admin dashboard immediately
3. User remains in database for record-keeping

### When Deleted User Tries to Login:
1. Authentication succeeds (Supabase Auth still has the account)
2. Profile fetch detects status = "Deleted"
3. User is automatically signed out
4. Error message displayed: "Your account has been deleted"

### In All Admin Pages:
1. Member lists only show active members (status ≠ "Deleted")
2. Task assignment dropdowns only show active members
3. File upload assignment only shows active members
4. Consistent behavior across entire application

## Benefits of Soft Delete

1. **Data Integrity**: Historical data preserved (tasks, files assigned to deleted users)
2. **Audit Trail**: Can see who was deleted and when
3. **Reversible**: Can reactivate users by changing status back
4. **Compliance**: Meets data retention requirements

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Delete member from team management
- [x] Verify member disappears from dashboard
- [x] Verify member still exists in Supabase database with status="Deleted"
- [x] Try to login with deleted member credentials → Should fail with error
- [x] Check task assignment dropdown → Should not show deleted member
- [x] Check file upload assignment → Should not show deleted member
- [x] Refresh all pages → Deleted member should not reappear

## Database Query
To see all deleted users in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'Deleted';
```

To permanently remove deleted users (if needed):
```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE status = 'Deleted';
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Add "Restore Member" functionality in admin panel
- Add "Permanently Delete" option for admins
- Show deleted members count in dashboard stats
- Add deleted members archive page
